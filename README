Fast and interpretable genomic data analysis using multiple approximate kernel learning

This repository contains the following parts that are associated with the manuscript "Fast and interpretable genomic data analysis using multiple approximate kernel learning", which is in press, to be published in Bioinformatics and will be presented at ISMB 2022.

1) R package implementation of the proposed MAKL algorithm and its usage to replicate the reported experiments.
2) R implementation of the baseline algorithm XGBoost to replicate the reported experiments.

Please note that this R package is accepted by and available on CRAN under the name MAKL.
If you would like to install it from Github instead, you may use devtools::install_github("begumbektas/makl") R command.
